# Code Refactor Starter Code

I was given code that was not in semantic HTML.

Some of the links in the HTML were not taking you to the proper areas on the page.

##### What i did to fix this

I looked through some of the HTML made it semantic. 

I changed tags that were not semantic.

I also tried to get the code out of "div soup"

## CSS Consolidation

I was also given CSS that was not consolidated.

Some of the CSS code was also being re-used.

##### What i did to fix this

I made sure that the CSS selectors that were being used for the same style were on the same line instead of being re-used on multiple lines.

I also made sure that the CSS selectors were targeting the correct HTML elements.
